This is a work in progress. I don't recommend using it in a production environment.

HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

1. Copy the dynamic_json directoy to the extensions folder of your Symphony CMS installation. You do not need to enable this extension in the Symphony admin to make it work.

2. Create a new datasource from the admin. Select the "Dynamic XML" datasource type and enter the URL of your JSON data.

3. Open the new datasource file in your workspace/data-sources/ in your favorite editor.

4. Look inside the "grab" method and change this line:

include(TOOLKIT . '/data-sources/datasource.dynamic_xml.php');

to this:

include(EXTENSIONS . '/dynamic_json/lib/datasource.dynamic_json.php');

5. Save it and your done.

NOTE: If you make any changes to the datasource from the admin you will need to change the include again.
